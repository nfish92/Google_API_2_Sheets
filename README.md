Absolutely, here’s a **clean, professional GitHub README.md** with consistent formatting, bullet points, and a dedicated section for handling sensitive info. This will look good on your repo and is easy to copy-paste:

# Job Tracker

This is a lightweight job-tracking web app originally built to help a friend track one-off service jobs using a clean web form that logs data directly to Google Sheets. This public repo provides a safe, deployable version with placeholder secrets — ideal for anyone looking to replicate or learn from the setup.

---

## Features

* OAuth login via Google
* Secure form submission (job entry form)
* Real-time logging to Google Sheets
* Render-friendly Docker deployment
* Easily customizable with minimal Python/HTML

---

## Prerequisites

* Google account
* Google Cloud project with:

  * Google Sheets API enabled
  * Google Drive API enabled
  * OAuth 2.0 Client ID & Secret
  * Service account with access to your Google Sheet
* Google Sheet created and shared with the service account
* Free Render.com account (or other Docker-compatible host)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Google_API_2_Sheets.git
cd jobtracker_Pub
```

---

### 2. Google Cloud Setup

* Create a new project at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
* Enable:

  * Google Sheets API
  * Google Drive API
* Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**

  * Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID

    * Authorized redirect URI:
      `https://your-render-url.onrender.com/login/google/authorized`
    * Authorized JavaScript origin:
      `https://your-render-url.onrender.com`
  * Create a service account and download the `credentials.json` file
* Share your Google Sheet with the service account email (e.g., `jobtracker-service@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)

---

### 3. Configuring Sensitive Information

**Important:**
Never commit real secrets or credentials to GitHub, even in private repos.
This repository includes only placeholder/demo values.

* Use a `.env` file for all sensitive environment variables:

  * `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
  * `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
  * `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
  * `ALLOWED_USERS`
  * `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`
* Use `credentials.json` for your Google Service Account key.
* Both `.env` and `credentials.json` are included in `.gitignore` so they are never pushed to GitHub.

**To configure:**

* Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in your actual credentials.
* Place your real `credentials.json` in the project root.
* For production (e.g., Render.com), use the platform's secrets manager to upload both files securely.

---

### 4. Running Locally

* Make sure Docker is installed.
* Run:

```sh
docker compose up
```

* Visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

### 5. Deploying to Render (Free Hosting)

* Create an account at [Render.com](https://render.com/)
* Create a new Web Service from your public GitHub repo
* Set the following environment variables in Render's dashboard:

  * `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
  * `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
  * `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
  * `ALLOWED_USERS`
* Upload your `credentials.json` and `.env` using Render’s Secrets UI (recommended)
* Set Health Check URL to `/healthz`

---

## Security Best Practices

* **Never commit real secrets or credentials to your repository.**
* Always use `.gitignore` to exclude `.env`, `credentials.json`, and other sensitive files.
* For demo/public repos, only include sample (`example.env`) or placeholder credentials.
* If you ever accidentally commit secrets, revoke and rotate them immediately in your Google Cloud project.
